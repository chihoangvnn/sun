# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons:
- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon32.png (32x32) 
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)

For development, you can create simple placeholder icons or use any cookie/sync-related icons.

The icons should represent cookie synchronization or data sync functionality.
